# Development of a movie recommendation engine
## Repository Structure
- Development of a movie recommendation engine.pdf (Working Paper)
- main.R (ML Algorithms: Logistic Regression, k-NN, Plot Based Recommender, Collaborative Filtering, Decision Trees)
- Data Processing.R (Data Preparation, Descriptive Statitsics and Visualisations)
- RShiny Algorithm Comparison.R (Proof of Concept for comparing the algortihms)

## Abstract
Today, streaming platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime or Disney Plus offer tens of thousands of movies. Given this huge amount, users face an information overload problem which makes the choice of a movie best-suited to their interests time- consuming and complicated. In order to increase convenience and the quality of movie selection for users, we present various approaches for making movie recommendations. We find that the presented strategies are complementary in the sense that they apply to different situations. Demographic and content-based filtering techniques allow to make movie recommendations to unknown users but do not improve over time. In contrast, recommendation systems based on collaborative filtering, logistic regressions or decision trees continuously learn from the watching behaviour of users on the platform. However, they require sufficient training and cannot be applied to make recommendations to relatively new users.

## Getting Started
### Clone the repository
- In R Studio create a new project and go to repository File > New Project > Version Control > Git.
- Clone the repository https://github.com/git-yifanzhu/machine_learning_hsg20s.git

### Data loading
- Go to data folder and unzip the files from RawData.zip directly into the data folder
- Execute the Data Processing.R file to process (movies.RData) for the main analysis

### Calculate and Build ML algorithms
- Execute the main.R file for estimating the different ML algorithms

### Check the different Movie Suggestions in Shiny App
- Open the Rshiny Algorithm Comparison.R and run the App on your local host
- Please Note: Due to the fact that all algortihms are loaded in the app, it takes about 5 minutes until the app is running since the main.R file will be sourced. Therefore, the app is also deployed under [R Shiny App](https://jan-scheidegger.shinyapps.io/shinymovierecommendation/)

### First tab of Shiny APP (Input a movie and number of Recommendations you want)

### Second tab (Input a User ID)
